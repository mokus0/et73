Work in progress

This project consists of notes and basic code for decoding the transmissions from the Maverick ET-73 wireless grill thermometer.  It's an older model, and I recently got one from a family member so I thought it'd be a good exercise to reverse-engineer the communications.  It'll also make it much more useful, since I can now use my computer to log the temperature data.

The notes should be sufficient to implement a receiver (and maybe a compatible transmitter too) with any technology that can operate at the appropriate frequency.  The code is intended for use with an RTL-SDR device but shouldn't be hard to adapt to any other SDR.
